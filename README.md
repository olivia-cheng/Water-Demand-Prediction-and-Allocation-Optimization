## Background
This competition is about prescriptive analytics using SAS software. Based on the business problem, we conducted water demand forecasting allocation optimization to provide optimal solution for minimizing water cost.

## Introduction
Building T is the corporate headquarters of the XYZ Corporation. The water used in Building T comes from two sources. The first source is through The Water Co., where like other businesses in the area, the XYZ Corporations has a contract in place with The Water Co. to provide water to their Building T at a contracted price per gallon. 
The second source is through XYZâ€™s own Water Storage Tank. Precipitation is collected, treated, stored, and used to supply water to Building T, and there is a per-gallon cost associated with this process.
